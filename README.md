# Revisions

This is the first approach at me revising all the knowledge I gained during <Academia de CÃ³digo_>'s 14 week immersive and inclusive Java bootcamp.

These are small exercises:

* Hello World
    Self descriptive :);
* Missing Char
    Removes a specific character form a string and prints it without the missing character.
* Not a String
    Evaluates if a given string starts with "Not ", and if it doesn't, adds the word to the beginning of the sentence. Otherwise, prints the string as is.
* FrontBack
    Changes the last character of a given string with its first character;
* Calculator
    An oversimplified calculator to show the articulation between classes, properties and methods;
* Guess a Number
    *Description pending.*
